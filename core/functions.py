    *   If ``$PLAMSDEFAULTS`` variable is in your environment and it points to a file, this file is used (executed as a Python script).
    *   If ``$AMSHOME`` variable is in your environment and ``$AMSHOME/scripting/scm/plams/plams_defaults`` exists, it is used.
    *   Otherwise, the path ``../plams_defaults`` relative to the current file (``functions.py``) is checked. If defaults file is not found there, an exception is raised.

    Then a |JobManager| instance is created as ``config.default_jobmanager`` using *path* and *folder* to determine the main working folder. Settings for this instance are taken from ``config.jobmanager``. If *path* is not supplied, the current directory is used. If *folder* is not supplied, ``plams_workdir`` is used.  If *use_existing_folder* is True and the working folder already exists, PLAMS will not create a new working folder with an incremental suffix (e.g. plams_workdir.002). Instead, it will just use the pre-existing folder (note: that this might lead to issues if the working folder is not empty).

    Optionally, an additional `dict` (or |Settings| instance) can be provided to the `config_settings` argument which will be used to update the values from the ``plams_defaults``.
