.. _pyAHFCDOS:

Vibronic Density of States using the AH-FC method
-------------------------------------------------

The ``FCFDOS`` class allows one to easily calculate the density of states for an energy or charge transfer at the AH-FC level of theory by combining the results from two vibronic spectra calculations.

For an example, see :ref:`Vibronic Density of States with ADF<fcf_dos>`.
