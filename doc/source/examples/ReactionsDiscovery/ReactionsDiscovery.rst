Example illustrating how to use ReactionsDiscovery with AMS.

To follow along, either

* Download :download:`reactions_discovery.py` (run as ``$AMSBIN/amspython reactions_discovery.py``).
* Download :download:`reactions_discovery.ipynb` (see also: how to install `Jupyterlab <../../../Scripting/Python_Stack/Python_Stack.html#install-and-run-jupyter-lab-jupyter-notebooks>`__ in AMS)

.. note::

    Reactions Discovery depends on randomly filling a space with molecules. You are likely to get somewhat different results if you run this example!
