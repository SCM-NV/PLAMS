.. _MoleculesTable:

Table molecule counts from reactive MD ams.rkf
=================================================

If you run a reactive molecular dynamics simulation with for example ReaxFF, you may want to see how the number of molecules of different types changes with time.

Run the below script providing the ams.rkf file as the first (and only) command-line argument.

**Example usage:** (:download:`Download MoleculesTable.py <../../../examples/MoleculesTable.py>`)
